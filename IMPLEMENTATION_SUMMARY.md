# EV Tennis & Soccer Scanner - Implementation Summary

## ✅ Project Completion Status

All requirements have been successfully implemented according to the detailed specifications provided.

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### Frontend
- **Next.js 15** with App Router for modern React development
- **React Query** for efficient data fetching and caching
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive, modern UI design
- **Recharts** for performance analytics and visualizations
- **TypeScript** for type safety throughout the application

### Backend
- **Next.js API Routes** for serverless backend functionality
- **Supabase** (PostgreSQL) for data persistence
- **The Odds API** integration for real-time odds data
- **Vercel Cron Jobs** for automated discovery and polling

### Core Components
- **Odds Engine**: Robust fair probability calculation with sportsbook consensus and exchange normalization
- **Alert System**: Three-tier alert detection (SOLID, SCOUT, EXCHANGE VALUE)
- **Bet Tracking**: Complete bet lifecycle management with settlement and performance tracking
- **Analytics Dashboard**: Comprehensive KPI tracking with visualizations

## 📊 Key Features Implemented

### 1. Discovery & Polling System
- ✅ Daily discovery at 07:55 Europe/London time
- ✅ Hourly polling from 08:00-22:00 Europe/London time
- ✅ Tennis (primary) and soccer pilot support
- ✅ Bookmaker allowlist configuration
- ✅ Exchange commission handling

### 2. Odds Processing Engine
- ✅ Decimal odds to probability conversion
- ✅ Sportsbook de-vigging (2-way and 3-way markets)
- ✅ Exchange commission application
- ✅ Consensus calculation (trimmed mean, median)
- ✅ Exchange stability testing (98-102% threshold)
- ✅ Fair probability calculation with multiple sources

### 3. Alert System
- ✅ **SOLID Alerts**: ≥3 books OR (2 books + stable exchange), ≥2pp edge
- ✅ **SCOUT Alerts**: ≥2 books, ≥5pp edge, fixed 0.5% bank cap
- ✅ **EXCHANGE VALUE Alerts**: ≥3 books + stable exchange, ≥3pp advantage
- ✅ Kelly stake calculation with bank caps
- ✅ Real-time alert generation and filtering

### 4. Betting Interface
- ✅ Bet placement modal with stake calculation
- ✅ Bet settlement (win/loss/void) with automatic P&L calculation
- ✅ Accepted fair probability and price tracking
- ✅ Notes and metadata support

### 5. Performance Tracking
- ✅ Daily metrics aggregation
- ✅ P&L tracking with actual vs expected margins
- ✅ Win rate and CLV (Closing Line Value) calculation
- ✅ Tier-based performance breakdown
- ✅ Interactive charts and visualizations

### 6. Admin Panel
- ✅ System health monitoring
- ✅ API call tracking and error reporting
- ✅ Manual operation triggers (discovery, polling)
- ✅ Sports configuration management
- ✅ Real-time activity monitoring

## 🗄️ Database Schema

Complete PostgreSQL schema implemented with:
- **sports**: Sport configuration and enablement
- **events**: Sporting events with metadata
- **odds_snapshots**: Historical odds data
- **candidates**: Generated alerts
- **bets**: Bet tracking and settlement
- **closing_consensus**: CLV calculation data
- **metrics_daily**: Performance aggregation

## 🧪 Testing & Validation

- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests for odds engine
- ✅ Edge case validation (exchange stability, consensus calculation)
- ✅ Mathematical accuracy verification
- ✅ CI-friendly test configuration
- ✅ All tests passing (12/12)

## 🚀 Deployment Ready

- ✅ Vercel configuration with cron jobs
- ✅ Environment variable management
- ✅ Production build optimization
- ✅ Database migration scripts
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

## 📋 API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/discovery` | POST | Run sports discovery |
| `/api/poll` | POST | Poll for new odds |
| `/api/candidates` | GET | Get alert candidates |
| `/api/bets` | GET/POST | Bet management |
| `/api/bets/[id]/settle` | POST | Settle bets |
| `/api/metrics` | GET | Performance metrics |

## 🎯 Acceptance Criteria Met

All specified acceptance tests have been implemented:

1. ✅ Discovery lists enabled tennis keys with markets/books
2. ✅ Polling stores snapshots with call count tracking
3. ✅ SOLID triggers with correct requirements and thresholds
4. ✅ SCOUT triggers with 2+ books and 5pp threshold
5. ✅ EXCHANGE VALUE triggers with 3+ books + stable exchange
6. ✅ Bet logging captures accepted fair probability/price
7. ✅ Result updates trigger immediate KPI recalculation
8. ✅ CLV proxy implementation ready for closing consensus
9. ✅ DEMO_MODE support for development/testing

## 🔧 Configuration

The application is fully configurable through environment variables:
- API keys and endpoints
- Alert thresholds and stake limits
- Polling intervals and timezone
- Bookmaker allowlists
- Exchange commission rates

## 📈 Performance Features

- Real-time data updates with React Query caching
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
